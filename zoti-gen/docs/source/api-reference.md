# API Reference

Unlike most other ZOTI tools the API of ZOTI-Gen is not particularly
interesting, since it is meant to be used mainly as a CLI tool. More
important, though, is its exported core representation used when
creating [Template Libraries](template-libs), documented in its
respective page.
