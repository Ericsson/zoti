publised under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
(see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Ericsson/zoti/blob/main/LICENSE)
file in each package root). Each tool is dependent on open source
libraries, as documented in their individual manifest files (e.g.,
`Pipfile.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, `stack.yaml`).

The [ZOTI website]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}) is hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and has been statically
generated using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) engines with open
source themes. The theme authors are credited in the footer of each
respective page. All documentation excluding code samples under <{{
site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}> is published under a [Creative Commons

The project and its web pages are currently maintained by
[ugeorge]({{site.github_username}}) as part of the [{{
site.github.owner_name }}]({{ site.github.owner_url }})
organization. Contributors are listed in the [repo
