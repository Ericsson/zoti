# Synthesis Flows

A flow is a (transformational) design process, usually chaining
several design steps, for the purpose of solving a particular design
problem. Flows are generic and presented in terms of guidelines,
whereas the tools implementing them can be chaged or adapted to a
particular use case.


[Genny](genny)
: or “the ZOTI code generator”, is a synthesis flow tasked with
  solving the problem of translating declarative system models into
  deployable target code.
